"""Portal request-head deadline, using the sibling services' h11 protocol.

A fixed ten-second deadline starts on connect and after every response. Partial
header progress never extends it. A complete head hands timeout responsibility
to the app's body reader. GracefulCloseMixin releases the concurrency slot before
its shared, bounded drain and preserves responses already written to the socket.
